# shell-scripts

This repository contains a few shell scripts for `bash`. They have been tested
using [`bats`](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To read more about each script, open each script in an editor.

## TODOs
- [ ] write a `.gitlab-ci.yml`, that executes the `bats`-tests in a GitLab CI pipeline
- [x] copy the `create-docs.sh` script from the `dial2-doxy-gen` repository
- [ ] have the script be pulled in the `dial2-doxy-gen` instead of including it there
